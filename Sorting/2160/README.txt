First Try failed, it only passed 72 test cases rather than 96 and i will explain why:
This is because some digits can be the same, where it would not account for it. 
We have to use a way to iterate through the array and using a sort method. 
This is also more efficient, and I have taken inspiration from shreyatleetcode
